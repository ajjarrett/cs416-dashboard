# cs416-dashboard

This dashboard was created by Austin Jarrett for the Summer 2024 term of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's CS416 Data Visualization course. 

This dashboard visualizes a public dataset obtained from the United States Census Bureau (https://data.census.gov/).  The original dataset is available at https://data.census.gov/table/ACSSPP1Y2022.S0201?q=income%20and%20education&g=010XX00US$0400000&tp=true and contains information of populations, income, education, gender, age, etc. of different states in the United States.

This dataset was manually cleaned and the cleaned dataset is made available in this repository.
